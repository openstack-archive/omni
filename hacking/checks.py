Guidelines for writing new hacking checks

 - Use only for Omni-specific tests. OpenStack general tests
   should be submitted to the common 'hacking' module.
 - Pick numbers in the range O3xx. Find the current test with
   the highest allocated number and then pick the next value.
   If nova has an N3xx code for that test, use the same number.
 - Keep the test method code in the source file ordered based
   on the O3xx value.
 - List the new rule in the top level HACKING.rst file
 - Add test cases for each new rule to omnitests/test_hacking.py
