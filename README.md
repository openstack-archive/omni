OpenStack-Omni aims to provide a standard OpenStack API for managing hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
This repository contains Openstack drivers for various public cloud environments.
These drivers currently provide the capability to spin up Openstack instances, images, volumes and networks on Amazon EC2. We need contributions to support other public cloud environments like Azure, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace, etc.
Following Openstack projects are supported --
* Nova
* Neutron
* Cinder
* Glance

## Status
Development is active. Can be used for individual testing.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome. Specifically following areas need help:

1. Similar drivers for Windows Azure, Google Compute Engine and other public cloud providers
2. An easy way (automated) to add Omni drivers to existing Openstack Deployments.
