The directory where the Nova python modules are installed.

This directory is used to store template files for networking and remote
console access. It is also the default path for other config options which
need to persist Nova internal data. It is very unlikely that you need to
change this option from its default value.

Possible values:

* The full path to a directory.

Related options:

* ``state_path``

    cfg.StrOpt('bindir', default=os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'local', 'bin'),
               help="""
The directory where the Nova binaries are installed.

This option is only relevant if the networking capabilities from Nova are
used (see services below). Nova's networking capabilities are targeted to
be fully replaced by Neutron in the future. It is very unlikely that you need
to change this option from its default value.

Possible values:

* The full path to a directory.
"""),
    cfg.StrOpt('state_path', default='$pybasedir', help="""
The top-level directory for maintaining Nova's state.

This directory is used to store Nova's internal state. It is used by a
variety of other config options which derive from this. In some scenarios
(for example migrations) it makes sense to use a storage location which is
shared between multiple compute hosts (for example via NFS). Unless the
option ``instances_path`` gets overwritten, this directory can grow very
large.

Possible values:

* The full path to a directory. Defaults to value provided in ``pybasedir``.
